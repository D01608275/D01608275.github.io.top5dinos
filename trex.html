		<p>"The King of the Dinosaurs", The Tyrannosaurus or "T-Rex" was one of the largest fleshing-eating animal that ever walked the earth. This is my number one dino due to the fact that not only is it the most famous known dinosaur, but it is the powerful dinosaur capable of taking on heavily defensive dinosaurs like Ankylosaurus, or its natural rival the Triceratops with no fear or mercy. Here are the facts on Tyrannosaurus Rex:</p>
		<p>As mentioned before, the Tyrannosaurus was one of the largest-ever fleshing-eating dinosaur, and has appeared in many featured films than any other dinosaur known in existence. The T-Rex had a huge skull with powerful jaws with great crushing power lined with 7 inch (18 cm) serrated teeth. Tyrannosaurus is now thought to be capable of speeds of 30 mph (48 km/h), but in contrast to its large legs, it had relatively short-small arms. Although they seem vestigal and useless, they were powerful enough to lift over 450 pounds (270 kg). </p>
		<p>The Tyrannosaurus were discovered in North America, and Asia where the most famous species found in North America is Tyrannosaurus Rex; in Asia its counterpart was formerly known as "Tarbosaurus".</p><br>
