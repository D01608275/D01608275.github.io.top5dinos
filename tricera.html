		<p>Now this Dino could be an absolute tank if it wants to as it is one of the largest and heaviest dinosaurs known to man, and is a natural rival to the Tyranosaurus Rex. The reason I love this dino is the fact it can use his head plate to intimidate his foes based on the colors and design, and has three sharp horns that it can use to defend against predators. Here are the facts on Triceratops:</p>
		<p>Triceratops were discovered in Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, and Canada. As mentioned before, these dinosaurs were the largest, heaviest and most commmon dinosaur in Ceratopsian family. Currently, there are sixteen different species assigned to the triceratops line, but some scientists believe that only one species existed. </p>
		<p>The different variations that have been found in between ceratopsian horns have shown to be similar to modern horned animals such as cows/bulls. It had massive heads with deep, narrow, parriot-like beak with brow horns ranging from 3 feet (0.9 meters) long, and its frill could reach widths as much as 7 feet (2.5 meters) long.</p><br>
