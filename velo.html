		<article>
		<p>The Velociraptor was knwon as natural born pack hunter, as these carnivores are one of my favorite all-time dinosaurs because of the fact that they are deviant quick and vecious predators with a retractable claw on its toe and hunted in packs just like wolves, which is one of my favorite animals. Here are the facts for Velociraptor:</p>
		<p>These dinosaurs were discovered in Mongolia, China and Russia, as this raptor was a ferocious predator with the second toe on each foot packing a large retractable claw. The Velociraptor was similar in comparison to the larger Deinonychus and the much larger Utahraptor. Like the Deinonychus and possibly Utahraptor, it may have hunted in packs, but studies have shown that Velociraptor and Utahraptor fossils were not discovered together in groups like the Dienonychus.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, the Velociraptor was not as fast as a cheeth, or as smart as a chimpanzee, as it was suggested in the movie "Jurassic Park", but I will always remember that one famous quote in the movie:"Clever Girl"</p><br>
