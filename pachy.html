		<p>What can I say about this Dino? well, He is in my top 5 spot because it's cool the way these dinosaurs had strong thick skulls used to either defend themselves or show dominance when seeking female mates. So, I might as well give you some as well to go along with article. Here are the facts on Pachycephalosaurus:</p>
		<p>These herbivores (or plant-eating) dinosaurs lived during the late Cretaceous period. This was about 76 to 66 million years ago, in North America. The name "Pachycephalosaurus" means "thick-headed lizard", and it described this creature's unique feature: it had a huge 10 inch (25 centimeter) thick bone dome on it's head. At the rear of it's dome, were a number of boney knobs, and the animal's snout also possessed several short boney spikes. This dinosaur has led most scientist's to believe that the animal was related to the Ceratopisans (Which included Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Triceratops), although unlike most Ceratopisans, Pachycephalosaurus was known to be bipedal.</p>
		<p>It was also thought that these dinosaurs were known to use thier dome heads to either engage in butting contests for mates (similar to modern big-horned sheep) like I said previously, or to defend itself from predators. But that might not be the case, as research has shown that thier heads were not strong enough to make heavy impacts, as thier skulls lacked the shock absorbing feature, and there hasn't been any evidence to suggest these dinosaurs had used their skulls the way they did, based on scars or any damage done on a fossilized Pachycephalosaurus skull.</p><br>
