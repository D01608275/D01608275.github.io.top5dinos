		<p>Now this Dino brings me back to my childhood, the reason for that is that back when I was a kid I loved long-neck dinosaurs because of one my long time favorite movie "The Land Before Time". Even though the main protaganist "little foot" wasn't a brachiosaurus, he was a Apatosaurus which are still in the same order as Brachiosaurus. I just loved the fact they also appeared in "Jurassic Park", and these giant gentle dinosaurs were capable of using thier claws on thier front feet for standing on top of tree or for self-defense. Without further ado here are the facts on Brachiosaurs: </p>
		<p>Brachiosaurus were known as the largest land animal, based on a fossil that was found in Tanzania. Each of the neck vertebra was more than 3 feet (1 meter) long, and it had large nostrils located on top of its head. This had lead to speculation that Brachiosaurus had spent some time submerged under water. But, there hasn't been concrete evidence that these dinosaurs are capable of that, since recent studies show that a creature as large as this one could not have inhaled water, which in turn could have inflated their lungs against the water pressure at depths of total submergence.</p>
		<p>It is also known that its front legs were longer than its rear legs and when it sttod up it would be 24 feet (7.3 meters) at shoulder level. It also apparently had small narrow feet for its size, as the first digit of its front foot had a claw, as did the first three digits of its hind foot. The function of these claws have not been confirmed as of yet, but what I can tell you is that they have been known to be used for ranking trees and self-defense.  </p><br>
